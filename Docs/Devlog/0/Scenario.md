Hi, AreYouFruits here.
That's a first devlog of a series about Growing development.

Idea

So
We decided to gameJam together a bit, but didn't want to participate in any jam.
So we opened GameJam theme geneator and sticked to the second one that we got. 
The theme was "Growing" so we started to sketch a couple of ideas.
We discussed growing as a game about plants where you need to feed them.
Then we thought it could be a city-building game with **growing** population and then we felt that we want to create something about automatization.
Finally we chose to make a game where you automate things and after a period of time you get a chance to recruit workers and automate things. You as a player then need to provide your workers (a.k.a. citizens) with all the goods they need to live. The goal of the game will be to satisfy your citizens as much as you can.

We wanted to make our game world a planet so it felt more natural and deep.
So we remembered there is some way to create a sphere from triangles
